#### 📸 Project 1: **Manual Image Edge Detection with Python and OpenCV**
This project delves into edge detection—a cornerstone of image processing. By implementing fundamental techniques, it offers a hands-on exploration of concepts such as convolution, gradient calculation, and thresholding.

✨ **Key Features:**
- 📌 Implementation of manual convolution for custom filters (e.g., Gaussian smoothing, Sobel edge detection).
- 📌 Computation of Sobel gradients to highlight edges.
- 📌 Application of various thresholding techniques, including single, double, and adaptive thresholding.
- 📌 Histogram analysis for gradient magnitude visualization and threshold optimization.

📚 **Educational Value:**
Ideal for those seeking to understand the principles of image edge detection and how convolution-based techniques work. The modular and well-commented code encourages experimentation with parameters like kernel sizes and thresholds.

🚀 **Future Directions:**
The project can be extended to include advanced edge detection algorithms like Canny or adapted for real-time applications.

#### 🖼️ Project 2: **Local Feature Detection and Matching for Object Recognition**
This project explores feature detection and matching—key techniques for object recognition, image stitching, and more. It specifically demonstrates detecting and matching instances of a specific object across multiple images.

✨ **Key Features:**
- 🧩 **Harris Corner Detection:** Identifies interest points in images.
- 🧩 **ORB Descriptors:** Encodes local image regions for robust matching across variations.
- 🧩 **Feature Matching:** Implements two methods:
  - 🔗 Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) for basic matching.
  - 🔗 Ratio Test for improved robustness.
- 🧩 Visualization tools for displaying detected features and matches.
- 🧩 Benchmarking with test images under varying conditions like rotation, scale, and illumination.

📚 **Educational Value:**
A comprehensive introduction to local feature detection and matching, with modular code for easy experimentation. Functions are clearly named and documented, ensuring accessibility for learners.

🚀 **Future Directions:**
Planned enhancements include exploring advanced matching techniques (e.g., FLANN) and adapting the project for real-time object detection and tracking.
